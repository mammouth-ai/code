# Update notifications

Mammouth Code is a fork of opencode. Upstream opencode checks for a new release shortly after the TUI starts and shows an "Update Available" dialog. Mammouth Code never did. This page records why, what was changed, and how to test it.

## Symptom

Launching `mammouth` never shows the update dialog, even when a newer release exists on GitHub. `mammouth upgrade` works when run by hand.

## Root cause

The startup check was still scheduled, but the function it called was an empty stub. `packages/opencode/src/cli/upgrade.ts` contained a comment and `return`.

The call chain:

1. `cli/cmd/tui.ts` schedules `checkUpgrade` one second after launch.
2. `cli/tui/worker.ts` runs `upgrade()` from `cli/upgrade.ts`.
3. `upgrade()` returned immediately, so no `installation.update-available` event was ever emitted.

The stub made sense when it was written and then outlived its reason:

| Date       | Commit    | Change                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-04-21 | b0b0c7bff | `upgrade()` stubbed out. At the time the check compared against upstream opencode releases, so it would have offered opencode versions to Mammouth Code users.     |
| 2026-04-28 | 8e3228a17 | `Installation.latest()` and the curl upgrader pointed at `mammouth-ai/code` releases and the `code.mammouth.ai` install scripts. The reason for the stub was gone. |
| 2026-06-19 | f6b71917f | Upstream v1.17.8 merge. The conflict in `upgrade.ts` was resolved by keeping the stub and rewording the comment.                                                   |

Everything downstream of the stub was intact. `Installation.method()` recognises the `~/.mammouth/bin` install, `Installation.latest()` reads the latest GitHub release, the worker forwards global bus events to the TUI, and `packages/tui/src/app.tsx` already handles `installation.update-available` with a rebranded dialog that calls the `global.upgrade` route.

## Why restoring the upstream code was not enough

**Strict semver rejects the release tags.** Releases are tagged `v1.17.11`, `v1.17.11.1`, `v1.17.11.2`. `getReleaseType()` used `semver.major()` and `semver.minor()`, which throw `Invalid Version` on a fourth segment. The worker swallows the rejection, so the check would still have shown nothing whenever either version had four segments.

**Upstream defaults to silent installs.** With `autoupdate` unset, upstream installs patch releases in the background and only shows the dialog for minor or major bumps. Every Mammouth Code release since June 2026 has been a patch by that rule. The TUI has no handler for `installation.updated`, so those installs would have been invisible to the user.

## What changed

`packages/opencode/src/cli/upgrade.ts`

- Restored the upstream check (reference: upstream commit 23b594de6).
- Dev builds (`channel === "local"`) skip the check unless `MAMMOUTH_ALWAYS_NOTIFY_UPDATE` is set.
- An unset `autoupdate` behaves as `"notify"`. Silent installs now require `"autoupdate": true` in the global config.
- Only a release newer than the running version triggers anything. A dev binary that is ahead of the latest release is left alone.

`packages/opencode/src/installation/index.ts`

- `compareVersions()` and `getReleaseType()` compare numeric segments instead of using `semver`, so four-segment tags work. `1.17.11.1` to `1.17.11.2` is a patch, `1.17.11.2` to `1.18.0` is a minor, `1.17.11.2` to `2.0.0` is a major.
- `method()` returns `"curl"` for a binary under `.mammouth/bin` and `"unknown"` for anything else. The upstream package-manager probes (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, brew, scoop, choco) are gone. They detect an unrelated opencode install and would compare against its versions.
- On Windows the in-app upgrade fetches `install.ps1` and runs it with `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File` from a temp file. It used to pipe the PowerShell script into bash or sh.

`packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/upgrade.ts`

- `--method` only accepts `curl`. The other values installed the upstream `opencode-ai` package.

`packages/opencode/test/installation/installation.test.ts`

- Tests for version comparison, release classification, install-method detection, and the Windows script runner.

### Behaviour by `autoupdate` value

| `autoupdate` in global config               | Newer patch release                               | Newer minor or major release |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| unset or `"notify"`                         | dialog                                            | dialog                       |
| `true`                                      | silent install, then `installation.updated` event | dialog                       |
| `false`, or `MAMMOUTH_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1` | nothing                                           | nothing                      |

The env flags also accept the upstream names `OPENCODE_ALWAYS_NOTIFY_UPDATE` and `OPENCODE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE`.

## How to test

Force the dialog regardless of version, including from a dev checkout:

```sh
MAMMOUTH_ALWAYS_NOTIFY_UPDATE=1 bun run dev
```

The same variable works on an installed binary. A real notification only appears when GitHub has a release newer than the installed one, so with the latest release installed this flag is the only way to see the dialog. In a dev checkout the "Update now" button fails with "Unknown installation method" because the running binary is not under `.mammouth/bin`. The dialog is what is being verified there.

Unit tests:

```sh
cd packages/opencode && bun test test/installation
```

Without a TTY, `packages/opencode/script/check-upgrade.ts` drives `upgrade()` directly and prints the global events it emits. Bake in an installed version with `bun --define` to simulate a release binary. Run it from `packages/opencode`:

```sh
bun run --define 'OPENCODE_VERSION:"1.17.11.1"' --define 'OPENCODE_CHANNEL:"latest"' script/check-upgrade.ts
```

## Verification (2026-09-03)

- `bun test test/installation` in `packages/opencode`: 16 tests pass, including the new version, method and Windows runner tests.
- `bun run typecheck` in `packages/opencode`: clean.
- `upgrade()` driven directly against the live GitHub releases API, latest release v1.17.11.2 at the time:

| Scenario                                             | Result                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| installed 1.17.11.1, no flags                        | `installation.update-available` with version 1.17.11.2 |
| installed 1.17.11.2                                  | no event                                               |
| installed 1.18.0, ahead of the latest release        | no event                                               |
| dev build, `MAMMOUTH_ALWAYS_NOTIFY_UPDATE=1`         | `installation.update-available` with version 1.17.11.2 |
| dev build, no flags                                  | no event, no network call                              |
| installed 1.17.11.1, `MAMMOUTH_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1` | no event, no network call                              |

## Known limitations

- `Installation.latest()` calls the GitHub API without authentication. That is 60 requests per hour per IP, one per launch. Behind a shared office IP the check fails silently once the quota is used. Following the redirect on `https://github.com/mammouth-ai/code/releases/latest`, or serving a version file from `code.mammouth.ai`, would avoid the quota.
- The Windows runner is covered by a unit test with a mocked process spawner. It has not been exercised on a real Windows machine.
- The npm, brew, scoop and choco branches in `Installation.latest()` and `Installation.upgrade()` still point at upstream opencode packages. They are unreachable now that `method()` never returns those values. They were left in place to limit conflicts with upstream merges.
- The TUI has no toast for `installation.updated`, so an opt-in silent install gives no feedback until the next restart.
- `packages/tui/src/app.tsx` logs `installation.update-available` to the console when the event arrives. That line is upstream code.
